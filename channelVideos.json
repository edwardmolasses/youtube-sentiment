    "transcript": "how much Mira should you have should you hold should you own I want to help you answer this question because I've been speaking about this coin from time you know if you've been watching my channel you know as well if you're patreon you know I still think this time how much should you have should you hold is it sound interesting I'm just talking too much of it do Jo to like give me subscribe I remember speaking about this right from I I feel like it was literally the bottom of this Market cuz I remember talking to my mom when it's s about 001 and what a few weeks few weeks ago I was talking about buying M noes right and in that story I was telling you guys about I was talking to my mom about 0015 0015 was the cheapest I saw mirria or you know that I thought to be buy a mirria cuz I remember I thought if I put 1,500 that bags me a million and I just thought I'm just going to grab a million anyway cuz you know I've been hyping up the noes the nodes you if you're if you flipping b or no you're sitting large you're making nice passive income that's an infinite amount of money it's like you you basically got a golden key to this golden chest you know like when you're playing Zelda and you're it goes just look inside miror tokens that's what we've got and I feel like I've been trying to push you guys to grab it because I can see it's a longtime lifetime of abundance with these Miron noes if you haven't got a Miron node yet I highly recommend before this starts to go up even more because the the longer you take and other people buy the price of the not gets higher and higher if you haven't seen these videos yet make sure you check it this one here Mir and no set up now way before that you i' talking about this for time you go back here we go by Mir no watch this I was up for flipping two get out I was up since 2: 3 a.m. at night trying to make these videos for you cuz I was so certain so certain I said guys you need to buy a flipping node because I know what's going to happen I said what's going to happen you know cuz I was telling my mom at 0015 it's going to start going up 002 003 08 a penny look at this 0.12 then it's going to to 3 cents 8 cents 20 cents it's it's then people are going to realize that the node pays for itself within a month you put x amount I think it's like 4 unless it's gone up now you put x amount $1,000 cuz you know if you can afford it $445,000 is a lot of money I know but if you can afford it you're setting yourself up for greatness cuz I saw the same thing with Gala I saw it it's like a a weird Loop continuation it's like it's like it's happening again and you you guys know right if you saw me back then back in 2019 or whenever it was on I was 10 year back Gala you know you're feeling it again if especially if you bought the Miron no cuz now you're sitting large I don't know how much they dishing out now but I do know the more people that grab the nose obviously it has to be distributed fairly between everyone let's just say it's like 1,700 tokens a day you're getting at the minute you're getting $20 almost 21 something even if it was that you're getting about $20 a day right let's just do this 1,700 I don't know what it is right now it's going to change all the time if you times out by roughly 30 days in a month 51 Grand actually this isn't even about the M noes how much should you have but I just wanted to push it to you you know the link is in the info section if you can afford it grab a m node if you can't fine grab something because I feel like this is going to move yeah this is not Financial advice I feel like it's going to move um and it has been moving since you know since I showed you guys way back here 015 we're almost up 10x this has had an insane move in the last sort of what is this 6 months 180 days is 6 months how much did you have back then it was easy to bag a million so patrons if you've got a million shout to you it's going to be very hard now for average people and and you know I see myself as average it's got to keep it real money's you know citto did be good but I still live an average life I think now 100,000 is going to have to be that goal guys because unless you've got flipping 12 Grand just sitting there no that's 100,000 right there unless you got 12 Grand just sitting there it's very hard to bag a million tokens now it was easy months back when I was telling you to but now it's flipping hard so that's out of the question I can't I couldn't even that even that is hard for you know because I like when I when I share you videos I try to think about people like baby moms you know dads that are struggling that are working hard for themselves trying to make a good living you know I'm thinking about you guys cuz that's where I was I was I was struggling years and years and years and years ago and I I tried to think about if I put 20 quid in this or if I put 100 quid in this what is it going to make me in the future so this is a very hard sum to reach I know that this might take people maybe 6 months 7 months but if you're smart with your money you're not wasting it on your egg fried rice black bean sauce what else do I get flipping porn crackers and chips some Singapore noodles I get the whole shebang if if you're not wasting your money on that stuff every time if you're not wasting money on going out you know constantly drinking and you're staying focused and you're making the sacrifice if you're not going on holidays I had a friend hit me up if you're watching hello sacrifice the holidays un you like go I know you like going away but you need to sacrifice cuz I sacrificed to this which is why where I am now there has to be a sacrifice in your life when it comes to what you're spending your money on if you want to invest to reach certain goals which can change your life in the future I think 100,000 tokens maybe over four to five months if you really you know put your heart down and the reason I say four to 5 months because I I keep it real right I struggled I was on the do you know in the call the doll you might just call it Universal now credit or whatever you call it but that's what I had back then you know my my job Seekers allowance my 200 quid every month for put it in crypto so over five months I was able to accumulate $1,000 worth of crypto or ,000 which is in dollars $1,200 so I think it is possible for people but they have to make a sacrifice and it's going to be tough it's going to be hard but just think about your long-term perspective and how much it's going to potentially change your life should this go to something like a 50 cense price and just do everything that Gala did all over again in a new Limelight under a new gaming platform and everything else so for those that are new looking thinking what is Mira it's a gaming platform looking to bring fantastic games uh I know my patreons have been hyped for this new game that's coming to mirria is it called Happy Land I see the flipping messages in there I see you check this out crypto Games Happy Land check it out crypto Games Happy Land I know you're buying f flipping Happy Land they've been buying Happy Land I know it's come to flipping miror as well I can't see it anywhere what's this no that ain't it uh they've been talking about games that are coming on Myriad and they're getting excited and everything else cool um is this it I'm trying to fliping show you flipping Happy Land Happy Land so I I haven't bought it yet I'm just sitting back I'm guessing they're in Mad profits if they are because this is all over my VIP group they're getting hyped they're buying this stuff uh I'm just sort of sitting back and just watching at a minute cuz you know I remember town star and it's kind of like your town star right uh for the for the G you got Happy Land and I remember town star how I bought some town star and then eventually it kind of fell through and I was stuck with them flipping tokens but I'm not saying this is going to do the same thing so it's good to see that you're getting good projects on you know goodlooking game projects come over to mirria which is great that's what you want to see which is all more of a reason for you to sort of bag up on Mira and just sit back and sort of just wait to to see what happens in the future with this token so me personally I think 100,000 tokens is good I'm going to bring a proper price prediction cuz I want to do it separate and you I'm trying to think about tokens for now 50 cents all great if it happens wow but I want to give you something realistic you can you can take with you on your journey and then you can decide what you want to do when you want to take profits and everything get it out everything else when you invest I'm just keeping it in raw fresh organic t um so yeah I think 100,000 is the mark what do you think I want to know what you think drop your comments down below was this entertaining in some shape or form could you drop that like for me I don't always ask I mean I don't always say drop a like give me subscribe it's like becomes like whatever but if you can please drop a like if there's you know 100 people watching and you all click like now that gives me 100 likes it pushes this video out to more people and then more people can see it and then obviously yeah it becomes more trendy and yeah just helps me out it doesn't cost you nothing so yeah um that was this and I'm going to keep bringing more M if you hold it great uh should I do a video on like the percent Club because I see it sort of like similar to like how Bitcoin is how people are hyped for Bitcoin and only a certain amount of people can hold one Bitcoin and things like that we've got a percent club for this I might do it 1% where only 1% of the world would only be able to have more mria tokens than you how much would you need I might bring a video on that so stick around guys I'm going to leave it here if you liked it drop that like please if you can it will help the channel and you shows if there's a thousand people right now and you all click like right now just a quick is it what is it not I got my

    "transcript": "welcome back to crypto Gaines for another video bringing you another quick update with this whole Ledger hack and what we need to understand going forward with Ledger and the whole hack if it sound interesting drop that like give me a subscribe going to dive straight into this I'm on Twitter right here with leder seen the you know few hours have gone by now and they've given us a few more updates we've got a message here from the CEO Pascal I think that's how he pronounced his name so I'm going to you know go through that with you as well and I can see won just an hour ago a tweet from Ledger itself saying update the genuine Ledger connect kit 1.1.8 is now fully uh propagated it says Ledger and wallet connect can confirm that the malicious code was deactivated you are now safe to use your Ledger connect kit so this is basically for all developers so people that are building daps know like you metam mask and sometimes like I said when you go on to mirria or whatever you go on to and you connect those people that are developers that are building daps they're now safe to use this new uh Ledger kit which will allow people to connect to their websites and everything else so that's what that bit is all about right let me just quickly go back to this it says you're now safe to use that reminder that we always encourage clear signing now for those that are new or for those that have a legend you've had it for a few years what do they mean by clear signing well you know sometimes when you go on something like pancake swap or whatever you decide to use when you want to make a payment whether you're transferring B&B to cake you know your your your metamask pops up it asks you to do the signature and on your Ledger sometimes it says you need to activate the blind signning in order for the transaction to work so this is what they mean you got two types you can turn it on and off so sometimes they say to you go into the ethereum app go into settings and turn on blind signing now that's the part that leder always always recommends that we should not do for most security reasons right and what they're saying is if from the moment that you allow blind signing to happen you are allowing yourself to blindly sign uh transactions that might have some form of exploit whereas if it's clear signing and that's what this part is talking about if it's clear signing then you should be able to see clearly what you're signing on your ledger to make sure actually it confirms what it is so how does how should this work going forward and this is my personal opinion I don't know if these big companies or big projects are going to agree with it but Ledger said well this guy here actually I I'll talk about what he said here that's I'll tell you I'll tell you my reasons right because he's already spoke about and I'm going to go over what he said he basically is this it is this the letter yeah this is letter it was basically saying that they've got a kit or they've got information on how going forward developers like pancake swap you know PE projects devs that use it pancake swap uni swap Sushi swap all of these kind of swaps and apps you know projects that are using daps D apps like this you know what they're making daps where you can connect in defy and everything else they all have an uh a tutorial that Ledger's given them so they can make it so people can use their Ledger Nano to do a a clear Sig in so we should no longer have to go into ethereum no longer have to click settings no longer have to click enable blind signing if these people if the you know the devs you know pancake swap uni swap Sushi if they start allowing clear signing so that's what I think should personally be going happening forward you know going forward that's what they should be doing I think all of these serious comp projects like the pancake swaps Sushi swaps and all these other ones same with all your favorite coins with whether it's uh Mira no matter who it is that offers these things where you allow your wallet to connect whether it's your trust wallet or metam mask if they're serious if these projects are serious they're going to go on to Ledger and they're going to make sure they update it so we can start doing clear signing instead of having to do blind signing and this will start to differentiate I think I said the word right definate yeah basically show you which projects are more serious about their security for their Community compared to the ones that aren't because the ones that are not serious about their security for the for their own community and their own you know people that use their project it's just they're just going to ignore it completely they're not going I want to uh update to this clear signing they just going to stick with the blind signing and that's where the issue May lie uh for people going forward cuz don't get twisted it's not just Ledger that could face this issue trust wallets any kind of wallet that makes you sign a transaction that has on their thing maybe a blind signature authorization they could have the same exploit so let's have a quick look at what this guy was saying he was going hi everyone today we experienced an exploit and up here things to know right just just letting you know about all what happened I might drop a link to this so you can have a little read for as well uh today we experienced an exploit on The Ledger connect kit a JavaScript library that implements let turn my phone off it's going crazy uh sorry a JavaScript library that implements a button allowing users to connect their Ledger device to third party daps will it connect and you've seen it before in loads of different things I've seen it on moon beam things that when you're staking all these kind of places and it says this exploit was the result of a former employee falling victim to a fish and attack now I've looked on uh Twitter with their post and a lot of people this made me laugh U there's a lot of people being upset being like you know why does a an old employee have access to the the the system still because they've left right they were former employee this person here goes my message back to you your order is placed don't don't make me laugh just I was in tears i s uh so uh yeah people just like you know why why doesn't the employee have access so you know I would like to also understand this reason why I think they say in the thing let me continue reading this uh okay just one time that's it uh we worked swiftly along fishing attack so the exploit was a result of a former employee falling victim to a fishing attack which allowed a bad actor to upload a malicious file to the ledgers npmjs it's a package manager for JavaScript code shared between apps we work swiftly alongside our partner wallet connect to address the exploit it says update in the npmjs which is that JavaScript thing here to remove any and deactivate the malicious sorry to remove and deactivate the malicious code within 40 minutes of Discovery this is a good example of the industry working swiftly together to address the situation it says now I'd like to address why this happened uh how we will improve our security practices to mitigate the specific risk in the future and share our recommendation to the industry so we can be stronger together it says the standard practice at Ledger is that no single person can deploy code without review by multiple parties we have strong access controls uh internal re uh reviews and code multi uh signatures when it comes to most parts of our deployment this is the case in 99% of all our internal systems any employee who leaves the company has their access revoked for uh from every Ledger system so the person that left didn't have the access he goes this was an unfortunate isolated incident uh it is a reminder that uh security is not static and Ledger must continuously improve our security systems and processes uh it says in this area Ledger will Implement stronger security controls connecting our build pipeline that implements strict software supply chain uh security to the npm distribution Channel okay I'm guessing every time they start updating firmwares or whatever uh with the with the kit they're going to make sure it's really tightly you know monitored and secure when it goes out to developers to be able to use uh it is also a reminder that collectively we need to continue a uh to raise the B for security around daps where users will engage in browser based signing uh it was Ledger service that was exploited this time but in the future uh this could happen to any other service or Library which is true that uses these type of things right third party apps to connect at Ledger We Believe clear uh clear signing uh as opposed to Blind signing will mitigate these issues so like I said to you when you have when you log into your Legend and you've got your ethereum app and then you click on your ethereum app youve got the settings button and then most of the time when we're trying to communicate with pancakes whoap and and stuff and it doesn't work if you got a new Ledger it won't work it'll say you need to enable blind signing so this is a message to Pancake swap Sushi swap Unis Swap all of the apps that we use the defy apps anything that we have to use which involves defy and web 3 connecting our metamask and guys please for tag all of these defi that you use if you're using pancake if you're using Sushi or Unis swap tag them let them know they need to hear this message clear really hope other YouTubers come on and sort of say this as well because I think it's important for everyone going forward we need these platforms to do what basically Ledger saying you know look we believe that clear signing as opposed to Blind signing will help mitigate these issues if a user can see what they sign on a trusted display unintentionally signing Rogue transactions can be avoided and it says Ledger devices are open platforms ethereum has a plug-in system that allows daps to Implement clear signing you see this every single app or dap that's been made on ethereum or even polyon or whatever it is even you know uh sandbox still has ethereum link to it when you can come to buying nfts and stuff you got if you're using Ledger you got to sign it if you're using openc you got to click and sign it open C's all of these should have the uh the option to enable clear signing and this must be a standard in my eyes and if you if you agree please drop the comments drop the likes let me know what you think send this on Twitter to everyone tag it let these other people know and if you are an influencer watching this if you're YouTube or whatever you are Tik Tok make sure we get this message out because I think it's serious going forward especially if you have a a ledger device and you've got more than $1,000 on it cuz all these apps I'm telling you that there this can keep going on uh unless we start giving people the the the investors or the people that hold these ledgers the opportunity to see what they're signing clearly and you know as far as it stands these guys aren't implementing this without blind signing so we need to have the clear signing enabled and like I said to you the ones that are serious like if pancake is serious uni is serious uni swap you're going to see it you're going to see that going forward they're going to allow all their users and all their Community to start using clear signing it says here uh uh who like to hey hello so let me just go forward sign so it's a and daps who would like to implement this protection for their users can learn how on develop ledger.com so there's no reason why these apps can't daps can't do it going forward they have to click on this uh in the same way we saw the community come together we look forward to uh uh to your help bringing clear signing to all DBS and I are totally 100% agree with us so going forward what am I going to do I'm can I can I highlight I'm going to start I'm going to go onto my ledger or ledgers and I'm going to go into my ethereum app I'm going to go into settings and I'm going to disable blind signing cuz when you've got serious amounts of money on a flipping Ledger it is not worth it I don't care if it's pancake I don't care if it's Unis swap if I have to stop using these guys I'm just going to stop because it's just not worth losing huge amounts of money over some stupid it because these guys might not want to update themselves so that like I'm saying to you the ones that are serious that want to prove that their project is serious is going to flip and update this and make it available for all users and those are the projects that will stand tall and stand stronger and forward mark my words Ledger has engaged with authorities and uh is doing all we can to help the investigation unfold uh as the investigation unfolds Ledger will support affected users in helping to find this bad actor bring them to justice track the funds and work with the law enforcement to help recover stolen assets speaking of that uh they dropped I'm not going to go for all this thing you can have a little look they actually speak about you know who they thought the bad person was or the bad actor they got the wallet address here so you can actually see all the things that were taken cuz I did this you know a couple of hours ago I had a look I went on E scan cuz I wanted to see what did they take who was who got caught up in this as it happened so you can come on to E scan you can copy this address that they claim was the vi the person that was doing this right here bomb you can see everything that happens they got this little red like warning thing now and all the transactions here like where it says two they've actually marked it Ledger exploer and these were all the tokens that were got you know that got taken before I go down look at this $100,000 was taken now as much as you want to hate Ledger cool fine hate them all you want if you want to order your treasures and everything else cool you do that and you and and fair play you have every reason to do so but let's just look at the border perspective here we've seen many hacks right and I'm going to show you the BSC chain as well we' seen many hacks in the last year flipping Celsius ft or FTX man hack uh cels well celsus wasn't really a hack either and we've seen hacks uh the multi-chain bridge right so many flipping hacks uh Harmony w 100 million flipping dollars 100 million they managed to tackle this at around $100,000 being taken which is in my eyes is probably a lot better better off than what many others have been through when it comes to hacks this is why I don't talk about Harmony anymore Harmony was a fantastic project but for me if a project gets hacked $100 million Harmony has to supply that back to gain my trust again because otherwise who's to say it can't happen and going to do it again you know where did that money really go who actually took it it's just it's just Madness so 100 ,000 sucks but it's not millions and millions or hundreds of millions right so you can come down here and you can see all the tokens some people actually you know this is a thing let me click on uh token transfers like this boom so you come over you can see all the things that people that were doing as they were transacting right so you got an ens what's this ens here 51 uh you got shipit in you 54 million shib got caught up in this render tokens 454 render tokens eluvium chilies you can see here right and if you come over look Pepe look 1.7 billion Pepe got taken through this because someone obviously signed a transaction at the time of this was going on if you click on 100,000 right here the token Holdings they've got $227,000 in tether they've got half a million Gala and they can't apparently they can't touch this it's all being frozen or at least the te has been frozen these tokens I'm not sure maybe they haven't been frozen but if they was to move it to an exchange you know they're going to know who it was that sold out right and they obviously can't sell it into tea or usdc because now it's been marked so they're not going to want to do that so I'm guessing actually I'm not even going to say what they what they might do cuz that might encourage them to do that and I'm not I'm not here to encourage whoever this person was I just want to show you what they're holding you can see clearly here right they got some beam tokens it's not on the grand scale of a hack it's not huge amounts and just to click on this to see what they you know take have taken over here you can find their wallet address it amounts to about $ 35,000 token Dollar in tokens you can see here like they got some USD over here they got Katana Inu uh they got a binance ped of ADA $4,000 pancake this are all the this are all the transactions that you guys have made which unfortunately went to this wallet so yeah I think going forward if you agree with me please drop a like like drop a like get this out to people get this out to these guys tag pancake swap tag uni swap tag tag other YouTubers cuz I really hope other YouTubers do this as well and push this message out there uh all you guys you know bit booy altcoin daily sup you know Joey Joe Perry I know you guys watch as well uh just get this out you know drop this to everyone so we can make sure that everybody watching us just you know if they've got a ledger they're going to stay safe going forward make sure pancake Swap all these guys start offering clear signing cuz that's the way we need to run now especially in crypto with all this madness going on so I'm going to leave it here they got it in French as well if you want to read it in French if this was helpful drop that like give me a subscribe thank you for watching it's been a mad day I only wanted to upload one video but um or you know or a couple of videos and now this has led me to upload more but I needed to because I wanted to keep you up to date with what's going on so uh become a patreon if you like links in the info section I'm not going to go for it uh thank you for watching and I look forward to seeing you in my next video cheers already won never be defeated [Music] already feel",

    "transcript": "welcome back to crypto Gaines for another video it's going to be a quick video I want to show you what I've seen over in Twitter all about Ledger being hacked and just kind of take you through what I think of it what's going on with this and you know what we should do going forward um if it sounded interesting drop that like give me a subscribe I have a ledger so obviously this is going to affect me and everyone else if you have a ledger so real quick it says there's only a few days left hold on no that's not it let me quickly scroll down and click on Ledger I had it up I had so many tabs up on Bloody Ledger hold on here we go so update 45 minutes ago hold on let's go to this one 1 hour ago it says we have identified and removed a malicious version of The Ledger connect kit now I don't know what this connect kit is uh real quick a genuine version is being pushed to replace the malicious file now it says do not interact with any daps for the moment we will keep you informed as the situation evolves it's says your uh your Ledger device and Ledger live were not compromised so from what I can gather with all these posts that I've been reading I'll take you through the rest um apparently they've done something to make you uh lose your funds in a sense when you connect to daps third party daps so whether it be I don't even know if I'm just using mirror for example when you can connect your wallet up here sometimes it asks you to you know sign in with your your metamask or if you're doing it on pancake swap some times it asks you to do it with your metamask and that's the part where it's hitting you right and this is the part where it's apparently draining people's accounts because you're giving them permission so I want to take you through a few steps what they've sort of said hopefully you you haven't been affected by this and obviously we can take a look at some of the comments see what people are saying as well um so here got 46 minutes after that or 15 minutes after that which is 46 minutes ago the malicious version of the file was replaced with the genuine version at 2:35 p.m. the new genuine version should be propagated soon we will provide a comprehensive report as soon as it's ready it says in the meantime we'd like to remind the community to uh uh the community to always clear sign your transactions so I think what they mean is I didn't got my flipping Ledger on me when you when you go to make a transaction whether it's on mirion it wants you to sign to log in or something like that I'm not saying Mira is affected or anything uh you always got to look at your device because on the device it shows the the correct information it shows your correct wallet address it shows where you're sending the address too so you want to make sure that the one that you're looking at on the screen matches the one on your wallet address if it doesn't you're getting caught up with this scam and you need to be careful where you're sending things to and what you're approving so what they were recommending is just don't do nothing for now that's if this is even real because a lot of people in the comments are starting to suggest you know is is is The Ledger Twitter been hacked is this part of the hack to make you you know to make maybe the next post is oh look we're fine now click this link and then everything we'll be fine the time will tell I'll bring you a video what comes comes about but what I would do for now is don't connect your ledger to anything if you hold huge amounts of crypto uh definitely don't connect it to nothing no daps right now just wait and see what happens as time goes on uh and if you do obviously you're doing that at your own risk it says remember that the addresses and the information presented on your Ledger screen is the only genuine information it says if there's a difference between the screen shown on your Ledger if there's a difference between the screen shown on your Ledger device and your computer or phone it says stop the transaction immediately so guys please really take that serious really look into what you're doing before you make any more transactions at this moment in time of your Ledger it says here never ever share your 24-word secret recovery phrase and the reason I'm bringing this up is cuz there's a lot of new people you buy yourself a legend n you don't know what to do with it and you know sometimes people give out their their seed phrase so that was a bit of what's going on right now of Ledger obviously it's going to confuse a lot of people upset a lot of people probably might not upset people if you're not affected you know by it then it's fine uh but you know just need to be be on point with this uh L just going down having a look at some of these things uh just see what people are saying about it uh hold on let me just see if I can click on this thing right here it's got 26 comments here so let me click on this and have a little scroll through on these comments uh Ledger support which don't exist may I remind you that profiles are case uh case sensitive I don't know what that means um I'm just going to go back real quick because I know they had an an additional post let me just quickly click on this scroll down uh just have a quick look one of them had a loads here we go look this one had like 1,300 comments this one's got 222 let's just click on this and see what people are saying I did drop a comment on one of these as well so we got Jacob Canfield here saying first you give them making me laugh uh first you give them my home address cuz obviously apparently they're they leaked out people's addresses before then you give them my money do you want to give them my wife and kids too I don't want to laugh but some people to chy to make happiness out it you got Miss team kitto here why don't you open source your wallet which is true in a sense but then would that open up more problems in the future once people know your open source right I don't know obviously it give everyone else the opportunity that's in this uh sector that's trying to make safe wallets to be able to do what they do as well because then they've got the secret Source uh it says you forgot to tag portal coin I don't I don't know what that's about uh let's see what else there is M was stolen uh from the zipper pocket in my hat can you please help see you're going to get you're going to get some silly comments some people already dropping memes on this look we've seen this before where people put this on top of like a you know an ATM machine and stuff and there's people here saying that they've lost $200,000 I don't know if this is real or not you I clicked into the comments just to check see what it's saying other people are saying they've lost $2 million I don't know and and it says you know you some my granddad s Grandma surgery and things like that I don't know if these comments are genuinely you know true if they have or not if they have you know sorry to hear it's a shame or if they're just joking about because you know you're going to see a lot of memes pop up in these things right it's a little list another day in cryp just another day in crypto so yeah overall I just want you guys to be safe pay attention to what's going on here it says how did drain a popup make it through your security and I think this shows I don't know if this is legit as well drainer popup is this where people are consenting to the signature and then you can see a sum of different money being moved I don't know I um this is all technical for me so I wouldn't even know uh but that's something else you can check out on their thing as well so look the main thing of reason for me to make this video just to make you aware if you've got a ledger and you're just about to do something stop halt don't do nothing wait a minute let's see what Ledger comes out within within the next couple of hours maybe there's something more right so I'm going to leave it here I want to get this up to you as quick as I can if it was helpful to you drop that like give me a subscribe hopefully I've helped someone who's just about to use a legend Nano for something and now you're going to stop and then it's going to you know make sure you're safe going forward uh yeah I'm going to leave it here thanks for watching subscribe if you're new stick around and I look forward to seeing you in my next video cheers deated already never be defeated",

    "transcript": "welcome back to crypto games for another video I'm laughing because I'm kind of doing this video after a prior video where I just went crazy but it's all good if you watch my Mira video then yeah this is kind of like the follow I just literally can shake after anyway uh in this video I want to show you some glass node analysis powerful information on the entire crypto space you're going to want to pay attention to this video If it sound interesting drop that like did I say that I'm saying again grab a coffee pull the video you back seriously because you're going to want to see what I'm showing you in this glass node analysis I'm going to show you a few things there the net unrealized profit this chart here I'm starting to see a hint of green come over here on the right hand side yeah a hint of green and if I zoom if I really Zoom this in the whole bar you know can zoom it in hold on come hold on cuz I want to show you like what the green means everything else come right in look you're starting to see some green green now right we're coming into this green for the net unrealized profit loss I'll explain that hold on let me just zoom this how you reset the reset zoom here we go and then I want to show you a new one that I found a powerful new glass oh this is powerful guys seriously this one here this is powerful grab a drink are you ready for this now for those that are new glass node analysis is basically information that you cannot find on trading view it's cuz it's information that's shared away from exchanges let me help you understand this when you come over to something like uh trading View and you search Bitcoin let me grab it up this is information that's been shown from exchanges so you're seeing all the relevant information that's been showed on an exchange which is why we have this uh price chart but when you come on glass node where has it gone where's my glass node here it is you start to see things that is not shared on the exchange this here is called the total supply for Bitcoin but it's it's called held by long-term holders so we got the black line which is the price of Bitcoin how it's been going up over years you know since 2010 to where we are now and then you got this orange line that talks about long-term holders and what long-term holders are doing with their Bitcoin seriously you can't see this anywhere else apart from glass node let me show you what I see I mean if you know if you're looking at the chart you can already see it right you can see how when the long-term in uh holders are are selling off their Bitcoin or getting rid of their Bitcoin how we see a spike in the in the market the top of the Cycles every time and this is what this is about total amount of circulation Supply held by long-term holders long and short-term holder Supply is defined uh Supply is defined yeah with respect to the entities averaged purchasing date with weights given by the logistic function Center yeah over 155 days and it says width of 10 days to make it super simple all you need to do is just look with your flipping eyes just look you can see so clearly every time we've had the top of the cycle that's when long-term holders have been dumping their tokens on us so going forward how do we know when we're at the top of the cycle cuz we're going to use this chart to show us when these long-term holders are getting ready to dump their Bitcoin so we're looking for the curve we're looking for all through like from here like this is what year is this 2014 2014 cycle and I'll talk about this as well because if you notice this Orange Line came above the price action in this specific moment right it came above and it hovered above for a period of time all through the bear from the depths of this where it hovered you know it hovered above all through the bear cycle of 2015 2016 and then you know the rally starts to happen again and then you can see the second cross here right but notice that when the market is really heating up and it's getting euphoric when everybody's screaming and they're happy cuz they're making crazy gains this was 2017's rally look at the long-term holders dumping all their tokens this is the orange line coming down down down down down bang so this is what I'm paying a close eye to and you also saw this happen here with the when we had this when we come out of 2018 bottom cycle cuz I was I've been here for years you see up here I remember this right up here if I was watching this chart because I wasn't wasn't watching it I would have seen that the holders the long-term holders are already starting to sell off their Bitcoin I should have been watching this back then cuz I would have been paying attention same back in 2020 2021 would you hear this cycle here we have the 19 event and then we see here look just as way before Elon Musk spoke about Bitcoin we started seeing prices rally like crazy right and I'm going to really come into this I want to show you just 2020 let me Zoom this in can I zoom Zoom it in is it zooming in I don't even have it's zooming in so take this Zoom it in let's just focus on this like seriously because we had the 19 event down here look look at how when price starts to Rally back in the last cycle then we start to hear about Elon Musk getting in with crypto Tesla and everything else but look what's going on as he's saying all that and as everyone's catching fomo these longterm holders that are holding Bitcoin Supply start to get rid of their their supply look they're all getting rid of it and as they're getting rid of it they're Distributing it they're Distributing it to you me him her everyone that wanted a piece of flipping Bitcoin and altcoins too because altcoins move with Bitcoin unfortunately which means if if Bitcoin crashes your altcoins just get dumped that's why this is powerful because we can now sort of see where we're going to be from the top of the market what am I looking for I'm looking for this so we right now we're seeing this this Orange Line start to go up like this take a look this is the future look orange line is coming up like this at some point you can believe whatever the flip you want to believe and I'm going to show you when it happens in the future at some point this is going to start to curve like it's falling off a damn cliff and when this starts to curve this orange line and starts to come down maybe when this this uh black you know the price is the black action when this black Price Line starts to come up and crosses with the orange line that's a sign that we is seriously starting to hit euphoric moments and when this curve starts to come down I'm starting to seriously consider selling the rest of my altcoins if this is helpful so far drop that like give me subscribe seriously this is a powerful flipping chart and not many people have shown you this if not no one if you know someone that's shown you this drop the comments I want to know who they are I'll flip and follow them cuz they're on ball they're Cy on point they know what they're looking for and they're looking for what I'm now looking for is looking at what this big money is doing because big money is smart money and smart money knows when to seriously take profits and when you start seeing a curve come down that's a sign that you're reaching the top of the market and is over drop that like see where else have I go over here so let's just talk about this NL like I said to you the last it's starting to flash green now and this is sort of the times where we see it flash green here so let's see before this 19 event it crashed down came back up I'm looking at when it started to first Spar green which was here and the reason I'm showing you this is because are we here in the market now before this massive rally comes over the next 6 to S months year are we here are we basically like what we was back here cuz every time I see the green one of two things either one we're just beginning this rally down here or two we are peaking out at this rally up here look but let's just look at this closely because the top of this sort of SP peaked out at uh what's the number here 0.6 see it here 0.6 is where this sort of as I say kind of kind of came up to here but 06 which means we're not far you know 06 would be about here we're not we're not far from how much more this green can extend on the right hand side 06 so if I put the line like this if you look over there you can see how far away the green line this green is to coming up to sort of 0.6 right so these are the things I'm starting to pay attention to what's going on how hot is the market heating up are we in euphoric moments here we not Euphoria cuz green says belief people are starting to believe now when this goes blue I'm selling the whole flipping lot because euphoric moments are the parts where you know you're at the top of the market we didn't even get blue up here but let me tell you where we did get blue and if this is anything to come by if this is going to do anything like what it did back in the last cycle 2017 look at this we saw a tiny bit of blue had you have sold when you saw this at Blue you are selling at near enough the tops of the market I really hope that we see blue this cycle cuz that's the best indicator to tell us we need to sell everything it is not often that you will get to see blue in this net unrealized profit I'm going to keep bringing you this subscribe to the channel I'm going to keep bringing you this you need to see when this turns blue so you know to sell your entire crypto make millions no one else is going to be showing you this and if they are great subscribe to them too because they're showing you some real analysis that you can take with you on your journey that your kid can understand I can show this to your 5-year-old son or daughter and say look look at the colors when it turns blue we sell everything okay Mommy okay Daddy and remind me Daddy Daddy it's turned blue stop panicking you start panicking because turn blue your kid told you to flipping cell people like how' you become a millionaire oh yeah my kid told me to sell when it was blue blue the pen is blue have you seen it the pen is blue the pen is blue oh gosh liar liar I love that stuff so guys this is why I wanted to show you these two they're powerful there's a lot more that I'm going to bring on glass node analysis I've also been checking this one out I'm still trying to understand this one a bit more and then obviously I'll drop another video on it uh this is the amount of circulating Supply last moved between 1 to 2 years and this kind of feel I feel like I'm kind of getting a hint of the top of the cycle with this as well but I'm I'm going to come again on this cuz you know I want to study it a bit more and understand it a bit more so yeah if this was helpful drop that like give me a subscribe I'm always doing something crazy in my videos I know but it's making you smile it's making you happy and that's what this is about having fun in this crypto Market not taking it too serious I mean take it serious

    "transcript": "I'm going to show you a project that has huge 100x potential is it sounding interesed drop that like give me subscribe which projects am I talking about if you're an influencer and you use YouTube or if you're on Tik Tok uh I don't know Facebook Snapchat whatever you're on pay attention to this CU if you use patreon this is just like your patreon but in the crypto world I'm talking about a project that goes by the name of Pacer I think I'm saying that right penger passenger passenger I think it's passenger create impact and earn now I like this because I use patreon myself you know if you're patreon you know right and I've had many people ask me I want to pay in crypto cuz you know I I want to be able to use your services so I might in the future maybe come over to Pacer cuz it looks good I've been looking for something like this I was hoping dies was going to do something like this they said they was going to but this is what we've got here so Pacer uh talk about there's lots to discuss about this project I've been doing a lot of research on it um this is not Financial advice so do you further research before you invest your money actually let me start with the website and then I'll come because I got loads of tabs open actually hold on hold on no I'm not I'm going to come over to here they've got things like uh actually no I'll start with the website so create impact earn it says what is Pacer Pacer is the best place for creators to provide exclusive access to their work and to get deeper connection with the communities so it doesn't have to be just uh influencers you could be a musician and maybe you want to you know make a little membership tier thing for your people so they can come over and support you you can be anything it says everything here all at once we have everything you need to start monetizing your audience uh uh yeah uh different services are no longer needed so apparently uh this offers zero commission fees is that right cuz you know when you use patreon they can charge up to 8 to 12% in fees and you know if you use it right these guys are claiming to do zero fees which is great I'm going to show you the price and Stu your price up here check that in a second it says here memberships I think they've got over a million people using this I'm pretty sure I read that up 300,000 download 300,000 plus downloads in the what is it the Google Play Store the App Store so people are using this if you want to check this out do so maybe this can help Elevate you to the next level in your career by offering a a FIA service and a crypto Service as well because they can take you know your users your fans can pay in crypto which would be they got this token called the ego token told you a lot to discuss or they can pay in a what you call I don't that's the team here we go uh or they can pay in fear so I want to discuss all of this uh one thing I would say I don't know if they're going to watch or not it would be good if you could put this site cuz they you know when I come on to co gecko you've got the egoo I think I I think I'm saying it right egoo in which is this site and then you got Pacer which is like your main site hold on that's the me joining up to it cuz I'm going to show you all that lots to discuss it' be good if you can just put that EEG Co somewhere sort of on this page like at the top like a little link so that I'm not having to go to different pages maybe it's just me being you know picky but EO is the token that's going to push and uh build basically EO is the token behind this whole project or ego the ego token so you know you come over to coin gecko you can see here ego token I talk about tokenomics in a second I just want to sort of break down what we're seeing here cuz there is Big potential in this project so they got daily tasks here comment post you get you can get paid for comments posts videos the lot it looks like they're really trying to monetize on every little thing you can do you might be someone that just wants to start a chat group and maybe you just want people to pay to chat in that group so that's cool you could do that uh cuz I've been reading on it your reputation with this what does it say your reputation with and not just fans friends and family can use it as well call 50,000 creators plus I think there's actually 60,000 now and you can see here how different use use cases can come about so you know if you're a coach really like a football coach or or personal trainer artists musician bloggers if you're in health whatever you're in it looks like you can just use this is this people that are actually using it right now I guess these are people that are actually using Pacer right now everything you really need in one place so again when you look at this you know looks similar to like the patreons you can see how much someone's earning a month the active members you know stable support for your creativity says paid membership features allow creators to accept financial support by providing exclusive content that can only be accessed by paid uh paying members i' I've been looking for another solution so I'm going to look into this more myself if I decide I want to uh you know offer crypto payments this will probably might be the solution that I use we'll see as time goes on uh don't stress over creating exclusive content uh I won't change anything on my patreon right now cuz it's working for me uh but if I'm going to add to it to that extra maybe something like this is what i' be looking at uh engage your audience better than uh other services so it says with daily tasks and rewards Pinger will engage your audience and increase your income invite your subscriber to register using a unique link or a promo code and we will take uh your relationship to the next level says get even more support cuz I know there's some people over in is it the Asian side or India that sometimes find it hard to become a patron of mine and I get so many emails messages you know messages in telegram saying I can't join it because you know my country is stopping you know blocking the payment so this is why something like this now becomes powerful you know just use the ego token to pay for your membership service get even more support from fans says accept donations not only in dollars but also in ego cryptocurrency which your fans will uh can earn uh right on the platform by completing tasks now your income is not limited by welfare you see these powerful people trying to countries trying to stop you from earning New Life of nft Technology says turn any of your posts into nfts so if you have got a good following and you start creating posts and they want to own that post they can do that you can do that you can just drop it as an nft things are changing in the space people just want everything and anything listen I think nfts will grow again I really do uh over I dropped a post in my Twitter twter on my uh telegram groups and the patreon talking about how how nft is are acquired right now but all it takes is one form of narrative to make nft start blowing again I wonder if this would be the narrative where creators start just selling all sorts of nfts like their pictures their videos a lot time will tell content on demand memberships which is you know everything here just is patreon but probably on the next level essentially cuz you know offering this whole crypto so think is gamification with daily tasks and rewards Pacers will engage in your audience so sorry Pacer will engage your audience and increase your income so if you're someone that's like a YouTuber or you know a Tik tocker that's you know wanting to find a way to earn more or just monetize in yourself as a as a as a user content creator come check this out now let me just come over to this because there's lots that I've got open that I want to discuss let's talk about this Pacer launches Ido is the platform looks to solve challenges for AI so they they've basically partnered with who's this uh is it surreal that all deals in generative AI so essentially it's not an AI social platform or an AI sort of patreon decentralized is it decentralized an AI sort of you know membership platform that people can use to start generating AI art and stuff that's cool I like that I'm going to go more into the ego token in a second they also partnered up with consensus for those that are new this is sort of like consensus is like a a blockchain software company that does they have like an accelerator program that can get you linked up with big names big brands or just big companies so they hooked up with so you know Pacer or ego token hooked up with consensus to do uh basically get a fund from Amazon Google over $100,000 to really push this and make this happen so when you start to log in because you know this is what this page is here I just thought let me log in see what it's about see what the back end's like see you know cuz I use patreon I want to see what it's like you know you do your standard login Jaden terto you know just sign up test account I just wanted to show you some of the things that I'm seeing here on the back end right so click continue continue continue continue you can do categories you know what sort of thing influencer Creator just something for now just to you know continue continue oh stop I love but uh once this is I'm going to skip this for now any social medias if you want to connect connect your social medias now look at this this is what excited me because patreon doesn't do this it says there's three options to earn on Pinger all three matter so please take the time to fill it in so like I said receive messages from others paid or not you can you can set up a thing where people have to maybe you you're a busy person uh you're probably going to get stupid amount of messages all the time but maybe someone really wants to reach out to you and have contact with you and you could set up a tier or something where people can have paid chats that's interesting look media offers do you have specific offers uh for your uh specific things to offer your followers so maybe you've got like some music or some videos that you've made or some sort of content you can do that right here it says look it says uh uh add anything you want and earn money for creating uh for creating content on demand Foster Community hold on membership so foster Community this is probably just like the normal memberships that you get with patreon set up earning so I came over to here I want to charge patreons for every for each incoming message just if you want to talk to me you flipping pay me flipping 100 Grand I'm expensive man I'm busy man I'm joking uh I would probably just put that at zero if it was me but it's it's good to know that if you want to monetize and you know people want you want to get a hold of you maybe like as a on demand message sort of thing they can pay you can charge them for that if you want but um I like the idea it's cool I I just probably would have put it zero for me but yeah it's a good little idea for the chats so let's take a look at the next one which is the what is it the media media offers do you have specific media so if you're what's this dance for your music want to see me dancing okay so if you comic strip starring you okay personalized greetings again these are things that you can pay for I'm going to say not relevant for me because you know I usually just upload to the YouTube uh and obviously I send a you a private YouTube link which they can see on patreon but it's good that they've got that membership so add the membership tiers is this what it is you have no memberships add new membership and I'm guessing this is where you come now and you can start creating membership tiers uh what is this uh Foster Community Support month donations let me just click add new so yeah okay the description and what they're going to get for the benefits this works just like your patreon and bang look down here creating your tier it's interesting and I think there's room for something like this to come about in the crypto space very interesting so that's a bit about this there's more that I want to discuss let me just talk about the tokenomics cuz I don't want to dive too deep into the project without telling you what kind of gains you can make Pacer or the ego token uh is sitting on $1.5 million market cap at the time of recording this video it could go up because patreon see this first they have the opportunity to get in early and you know if you do want to get in early and you don't want to miss out on these things become a patreon the link will be in my info section click it I highly recommend people come to my exclusive VIP partner tier this is my most popular tier it unlocks all my posts so you don't miss nothing get a chance to get in early what else have I got over here so uh what's this over here the ego they've been certic audited so they went over to certic to get an audit I highly recommend you check the whole audit out just so you can see what's going on with their audit uh you can just grab that up on coin market cap you know I went on coin market cap searched the ego token cuz you know PES tokens called ego and at the bottom left down here you'll be able to see it hold on my M down here look boom certic on the left hand side you can click that and you can have a read through I highly recommend you do before you know decide to to buy if you want to buy something um so yeah I like the whole setup thing I like the idea of the tears and everything else it's cool I don't know let me just cancel this for a minute and just see what else happens I want to see what happens when you say when you I want to see what the whole sort of page looks like cuz it's all new to me as well so they know I have my page no supporters right now no followers uh create offers connect your social accounts just reminding you these sort of things that you can do yeah got that so yeah the back end looks nice it's clean nft Marketplace up here requests other creators you can probably see if you click on that tab up there cool and then it obviously it'll show you income hold on incoming chats nice people that want to get a hold of you quickly and On Demand look at this become a become premium so let's just quickly talk about can I can I log out at this and show you the main page again I want to talk about other things on here because let me just quickly go to Pacer Let me refresh this hold on pacer.com is it going to show here we go because when you click on pricing like I said they they're offering they're saying that they're going to give you zero commission fees which means when you join patreon they take a percentage every time you earn uh and they're saying that they're not going to do that so that's interesting or at least zero on the fees uh explore the transparency of our commission structure see the difference but when I'm looking at this it does you know you got the choice you can join up for free or you can join up with the premium so if you do the premium you're spending $19 a month maybe $20 a month so even though they're not charging the fees cuz you look down here at request and conversion fees is this because you're probably going to get loads of different people all around the world come into you and then they're probably going to be paying in different types of fat you know dollars uh uh I don't know British pounds Euros I was trying to think of another one lzos whatever the coin is I don't know what it is yeah and then maybe this is what they're charging for the the conversion fees it says request fees so maybe that's the only thing they charge and it looks like on the free version they're going to take 15% so that's something to think about as well you know and then you got to decide which one do you want to go for I if you know if I started this I probably would do the three first just to see how it goes and if I felt like I needed to get that little bit more premium then I'll go for the premium benefits but that's how I would do it unlock the full potential of Pacer when you go for the premium these are things things you get you get the status badge benefit name postage privilege all of this stuff gets unlocked automatic nft minting which you you know you might put up a a piece of content a music or something a track a song and then you upload it and then all of a sudden it's nft your people can buy your song straight away before everyone else right uh and you don't have to worry about doing the whole minting process it just does it for you I like the idea make sure you can see me uh Don't Waste Your Time start to monetize now cool now I like it I think there's huge potential for something like this so that was a bit on on the back end when it comes to like the pricing what else have we got we got creators and that just shows us the creators you see just coming down and showing you some of the people that are using this now and the fact that it's active and it's got over 60,000 people using this or more so that's the Yeah well yeah you'll have the 60,000 content creators and then you've got hundreds of thousands of people all their fans watch it's it's patreon it's patreon in the palm of your hand in the crypto space said ego token ego is the financial Foundation of is the financial foundation of the Pacer social network Pacer is an Innovative platform y just spoke about that what is the problems does penter solve I've already just kind of talked about that and talked about the AI with the partnership that they did so you got the the little tokenomics down here actually let me take a look over here $1.5 million market cap if this 10x is it goes to $505 million 100x $154 million I want to see real quick how much is patreon worth the reason I'm saying is because patreon is one of many types of uh membership type of things that we can use as a content creator it's roughly estimated to be about about $4 billion see that 4 billion so I'm not saying Pinger will go to a 4 billion but I'm saying there's enough room for this to move if it takes a chunk out of patreon you know people just get fed off a patreon because you know you're charging me too much they're flipping charging me zero I flipping come to you for they charge me zero no one's there they might take a steal of the share so I don't know just 100x puts this at 155 million time 10 10 is a 15 million time 100 is 154 million just under 155 million and then look what it does to the price over here bomb * 10 27 cents time1 $271 500 tokens in Supply is it worth even if you're not a content creator is it worth investing in this say to yourself if you had the opportunity to invest in patreon before it blew up and became really popular and successful would you have done done it because that's how I look at this I look at it like if I'm going to invest in this company this this brand or this this company is I'm investing in the next future patreon that's now allowing people to do things in crypto they've already got the use the usage base the users people are already uh coming over here and earning and offering their services it's not like it's saying it's it's going to do this and it's G it's already happening right now and that's why I wanted to share this to you and show you the opportunity cuz I know p I've got a few people in the uh I know a lot of the YouTubers you know I know you guys big up to you and I know you guys might want to consider taking payments right in crypto for your people so just saying check it out uh so yeah that was pretty much the basis of this drop your comments down below let me know what you think are you interested in this are you going to grab some this consensus thing is massive because you know they they do not just partner up with many random people so and they've got big Partnerships themselves in this space so you know looking to cons senses more the fact that they get they got an acceleration program with this you know and this is how they were able to get on things like this you know Google Play Store Amazon and everything else because that they got them connections which is Big so yeah come check it out I mean obviously anyone can go on this but to go on and just get lifted straight away that's where consensus comes in so come check this project out if you want to buy some you can buy this on quick look you can buy it on bybit bitm C coin I'll probably just go to C coin because you know that's where I usually buy that stuff uh and then you can grab some yeah so I'm going to leave it here if it was helpful drop that like give me subscribe I really want to know what you think of this drop your comments I'm eager to see uh should I be using this for myself should I have like my patreon account like normal and then have this as an additional for people to earn sorry for people to come over and see my uh alerts and everything else in crypto payments time will tell uh I might do a little what you call it a little poll to see but I'm not going to change anything too quick I'm just going to wait and see right now and see what happens but I feel I do like the idea of this like this is this is what I've been looking for right so yeah that was that patreon link is in the info section come over check it out if you can't afford it my CEO tier which is my next tier above the CEO gives you access to my VIP telegram group I'm showing them gems all the time I've been stealth buying coins that you guys can't see but patrons can see it and I'm not going to show it on YouTube until it does a minimum 10x the last stealth buy that I did which was hello we were buying it around a penny did a massive 10x 12x 13x and I've been buying more

regular has been rethinking its approach to spot bin ETF products following a recent grayscale Court decision in a CNBC interview on December 14th Gensler was questioned about the long list of pening spot Bitcoin ETF applications I know you're facing a window in early January what does that look like well Sarah we have I think it's between eight and a dozen filings I I'm a chair of a commission I'm not to prejudge anything so that's going through the process right now uh and as you might know uh we had in the past uh uh denied a number of these applications but the courts uh here in the District of Columbia uh wait in on that and so we're taking a new look at this uh based upon those court rulings in August a judge overturned the sec's decision to deny an ETF offering from grayscale Investments through its Bitcoin trust several large asset managers including Black Rock of fidelity grayscale and besco and Galaxy vanic and Valkyrie are now in the race to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF all applications have been delayed but sell analysts are confident that a batch of approvals will occur in early January 2024 in a separate interview with Bloomberg on December 14th Gensler also sidestep questions regarding the number of filings for spot Bitcoin products instead he spoke about the recent changes to the US Treasury Market as the focus of the agency's priorities in response to gensler's interview a US Representative Brian steel commented saying chary genser obis skates on crypto with the Press like he does the community hearings he does not want to explain his agency's aggressive regulatory approach which is pushing crypto offshore Bloomberg ETF analyst James safer said gendler very rarely gives clear answers he's a master at hedging his words but either way it seems 2024 is shaping up to be a good year for crypto with Scott mker on next writing jome Powell gave the green light to pump your bags if fed looking likely to Pivot Marcus rip ETF news coming having in a few months can anything stop crypto blockchain networks get praised for their transparency which we like but you don't want your national ID number out there on the chain for anyone to see or used to seal your identity right and that's because public transparency has its limits and if you want to limit how much of your public information others can see and access on chain that are Partners at dop and their selective transparency protocol are for you blockchains are public at least the good ones are so we've been conditioned to think that blockchain privacy is an All or Nothing Game it has to be not private at all like Bitcoin or ethereum or completely 100% private like secret Network or LF zero but that's actually not the case dop which stands for data ownership protocol gives you an idea where they stand just by the name they want you to own and control your data dop offers a chance for you to decide what when and how much of your data you want to expose to the public so it's not all or nothing real privacy moves on a sliding scale and sometimes it matters a lot if you're paying a bill online or maybe something that cost more than $1,000 then maybe you don't want others to see that info but then smaller transactions of sending $50 to a friend or buying a small free mined nft you may not care as much who sees it there's a lot of advantages to this method the biggest Advantage by far is that it's less of a hassle dealing with local regulations worldwide many jurisdictions are becoming hostile to crypto now and some of these jurisdictions have the guilty until proen innocent St even if they say otherwise and we recently asked you guys on X to try out dp's test net and they had so much success that it crashed their servers when 20,000 people signed up the first day but all is well now and the servers are back up and you can try it out now we have a full detailed article on how to use the dop test net to qualify for the airdrop which I'll leave along with the test net link down below for you to give a try our partners at open fabric AI have just had some massive updates open fabric AI is a decentralized layer 1 AI protocol for building and connecting AI applications where they've harnessed the power blockchain Advanced cryptography and Nel infrastructure to create a new foundation for AI apps in their ecosystem everyone has quick easy lowc cost and hassle-free access to powerful AIS now recently they just released their tools for developers to create AI apps in minutes that can be published on their test net then they also just released interoperability tools that allow you to interact with AI at a smart contract level across all evm compatible blockchains and on top of that they've also started onboard people to become validators and secure the network as well as let you monetize your GPU and CPU power through their infrastructure provider program Open Fabrics ofn token has been listed on kucoin a big at pancake Swap and is now being listed on more exchanges in the coming days to make it even easier to get check out open fabrics testnet validator and infrastructure programs with the link down below so what happened yesterday with the massive crypto hack that happened with Ledger The Ledger hacker who siphoned away at least $484,000 from multiple web3 daps on December 14th did so by tricking web their users into making malicious token approvals according to the team behind the blockchain security platform cyers according to public statements made by multiple parties involved the hack occurred on the morning of December 14th and the attacker used a fishing exploit to compromise the computer of a former Ledger employee gaining access to the employees node package manager JavaScript account once they gained access they uploaded a malicious update to Ledger's connect GitHub repo Ledger connect is a commonly used package for web 3 applications some web 3 apps upgraded to the new version causing their apps to distribute the malicious code to users browsers and the web three apps included zapper Sushi swap Phantom balancer and revoke cache as a result the attacker was able to siphon away at least $484,000 from users of these apps other apps may be affected as well the experts have warned that the vulnerability may affect the entire ethereum virtual machine ecosystem according to the Cyber CEO the attacker likely use malicious code to displayy confusing transaction data in the user's wallet leading them to improve transactions they didn't intend to they stated that when developers create web 3 apps they use open source connect kits to allow their apps to connect with users wallets these kits are sock pieces of code that can be installed into multiple apps allowing them to handle the connection process without needing to spend time writing code Ledger connect kit is one of the options available to handle this task according to the cyers team the malicious code inserted Into The Ledger connect kit likely allowed the attacker to alter the transactions being pushed to the user's wallet for example as part of the process of using an app a user user often needs to issue approvals to token contracts allowing the app to spend tokens out of the user's wallet the malicious code may have caused the user's wallet to display token approval confirmation request or the attacker's address listed instead of the app's address or it may have caused a Walt confirmation to appear that would consist of difficult to interpret code causing the user to confusedly push confirm without understanding what they're agreeing to they warn that avoiding this kind of attack is extremely difficult as Walts do not always give users clear information about what they're agreeing to One Security practice that may help is to carefully evaluate each transaction confirmation message that po up when using an app it is worth emphasizing that this recently detected security threat does not lie with The Ledger Hardware wallets themselves instead it resides in the adapter that facilitates the connection between websites and the hardware wallet meanwhile Ledger has promptly released a minor update that eliminates the malicious code Ledger CEO Pascal gothier addressed the supply chain attack on its Ledger connect kit in a post on Thursday saying the standard practice at Ledger is that no single person can deploy code without review by multiple parties we have strong access controls internal reviews and multi signature code what it comes to most parts of our development this is the case in 99% of our internal systems any employee who leaves the company has their access revoked from every Ledger system however that was not the case on Thursday morning when a former employee was the subject of a fishing attack giving the hacker an open door to Ledger's package manager it is still unclear how the employee maintain access to the system he continued by saying this was an unfortunate isolated event it is a reminder that security is not static and Ledger must continuously improve our security systems and processes The Ledger CEO then wrote my personal commitment Ledger will dedicate as much internal and external resour sources as possible to help the affected individuals recover their assets the tether CEO also posted on X that the attacker's address was frozen Mark Paul wrote on X saying The Ledger hack is draining funds the harsh reality is that all wallets and daps use npm based Libs public code sharing and can have the same attack Vector some Dev in a third party lib sneaks and drainer code is called the supply chain attack what can you do the best way for the end user you to protect yourself is to ensure that you do not trust any dap or browser based wallet and inspect all the transactions before signing for Ledger connected apps always clear sign transactions I.E check first if there's a data difference between the screen shown on your Ledger device and your computer or phone screen if you're not sure don't sign and ask someone for clarification when is it safe to use Ledger again and connect to apps for now it's best for you to lay low and not use Ledger connected to a browser until we get a global consensus that the issue is fixed so while Ledger has updated its software and the app soon to be updated like Mark says it's best to lay low for a while before interacting with defi apps again we also have a video on alternative Hardware wallets that are not Ledger which you can find link down below that's it for outome buz's

    "transcript": "we all know by now that it's imperative to be as early as possible in this space it is one of our perennial mantras here at altcoin buzz and in a general way we are all early to every project compared to the rest of the world but the huge outsized gains the one where you can make life-changing money are easier to achieve the earlier you are and so today we're specifically looking at projects whose tokens are not yet live and not yet public we have four projects with unreleased tokens really covering three major blockchain narratives ZK evm ethereum layer 2 and modular blockchains you pretty much can't get any earlier than this like I said the tokens are not yet even in the [Music] market welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz best of luck if you choose to invest but just remember that I'm not a financial or investment adviser so this video is not official Financial or investment advice we're starting off here at number one with ethereum layer 2 Solutions and rollups which are really one of the big narratives in crypto today and that's because they relieve us of really the main issues with ethereum issues of price speed and scale of transactions these continue to be problematic and one of the most popular types of these Solutions is ZK evm evm is part of the ethereum virtual machine and it's compatible with other networks like BNB and polygon and the ZK part is using zero knowledge proofs for added security now while polygon is the leader in ZK evm Tech Tao is an unreleased token that lets you take advantage of the trend and be early at the same time because instead of operating as an L2 as an evm it can operate its own chain and still be part of the ethereum network Tao is currently on the polia test net and its token generation event tge is unknown but the one thing that we do know is that they're setting up for an airdrop and we outlined some of the steps in a recent video you can check that one out if you haven't already done so and if you like the ZK evm argument and you think it may be successful then take a look at Tao it should definitely be on your radar altcoin Buzz Alpha would like to congratulate all of our members on a very profitable month of November 2023 during that time Bitcoin rallied past $35,000 and is now hovering around $43,000 but on the 4th of November we published an alpha report and mentioned these BTC targets and because we had a clear Target in mind we planned our November strategy meticulously and we not only achieved but we surpassed all of our targets overall we had 61% profit in BTC 100% profit on six of our portfolio coins 200% or 3x profit on our gems call 3 to 5x profits from four OS and $1,800 in profit on buy and sell calls you can get access to all of this and still join altcoin Buzz Alpha for only $15 a month you can also get an 8% discount on yearly subscriptions for more information check out the link in the description below next we're staying in the L2 Arena even though Tao it's not really an 2 but the best known project on this list of four today is in fact Stark net it's a fast growing ethereum layer 2 also using zero knowledge proofs and although it's kind of beyond the scope of this video there are two common types of ZK solutions that projects use they are ZK snarks and ZK Starks both are very good and most use snarks Starks is generally considered better for security and in this case that that is what Stark net uses Stark net also has a rapidly growing ecosystem this includes wallets Bridges and even Fiat onramps and as you've seen here we covered Stark net in one of our airdrop videos so yes they're setting up for an airdrop as well but no we don't know when they're going to be delivering or even when the tge the token generation event will be and the team's also been pretty quiet on the subject but that being said they keep building and it would surprise if the airdrop does not take place sometime in the first half of next year so q1 Q2 2024 that's our expectation let me know if you're an airdrop Hunter and if you're following our airdrop series uh in terms of the recent videos we've put out you definitely should be because as I always like to say the rewards that you get when you participate in an airdrop are vastly disproportionate with the effort that you put in you get really a lot in terms of monetary rewards for often very little effort the only thing is that you can predict with 100% certainty which projects will issue airdrops but uh the numbers are on your side if you cast a wide net so to speak so let me know what you think about airdrops in the comments below and by the way if you're an industrious fan of airdrops you want to do the work you can find out very early about them in altcoin Buzz Alpha next up and at number three on our list here today we're going back to the ZK evm theme again and looking at scroll Network so scroll is a layer 2 solution for ethereum and it's main net went live in October now many of eth and EVMS biggest players are actually using scroll including safe and okx wallets and the graph scroll even has an nft release coming out today the 14th of December it's coming out in about 6 hours from the time of this recording and they have also yet to announce their tge but with their mainnet live currently there are lots of things you can do to qualify for an airdrop and we covered some of those airdrop possibilities a couple of months ago check out this video I will link to it below and uh be sure to watch that for this opportunity if you're unfamiliar with what I'm talking about okay last but not least today we're looking here at a common narrative as well but it's kind of different uh versus the ZK evm and layer 2 stuff it's all about modular blockchains because we expect modular chains to have explos Ive growth in the coming years unlike a linear chain that does everything a modular chain outsources certain functions while retaining certain others and our modular chain selection for today is fuel Network fuel is an evm that uses ethereum for security while handling the execution layer itself they do it rollup style uh like the others they have no tge to speak of yet at least in public and they're likely doing an airdrop we also covered them and various Associated and corresponding tasks that you can do to qualify because building out a linear or monolithic chain takes so long and is so expensive we see modular chains as one of the big trends in the future in the near future and you can test out and be early on one of the leading ones before they've even released their tokens right now today good luck",

Ledger wallet connector for your safety please refrain from engaging with any daps until further notice revoke cash a service which allows crypto users to take back transaction signing Powers previously given to web 3 apps also took its front end offline to avoid users being duped Hudson Jameson the VP at polygon Labs wrote what's going on with the recent alerts not to use daps a library that's used by many daps that is maintained by Ledger was compromised and a wall trainer was added what do I do as a normal user don't interact with any dab front ends on websites for now this is an ongoing situation and it's risky to use dabs currently if you don't understand what backend libraries they use how does this strain your money if you visit the website you won't get automatically drained or your funds however prompts from your browser wallet like metamask will display that give your assets to malicious actors and now shner wrote basically some front ends use an npm package or Ledger connect that package has been compromised in a supply chain attack doesn't matter if you use a ledger or not if you connect and broadcast a transaction on a compromised website like orach whether you use metamask or rabby or Etc if you use a website that isn't compromised like defi llama you're safe if you don't know what you're doing better not to sign any transactions at the moment no need to revoke anything it's not about a approvals to which one user wrote If you have your assets on a ledger are you safe as long as you don't touch anything for now and you're responded by saying yes you're good just don't sign any transactions for now technically you can if the website is not compromised but better to avoid if you're asking that question as all of this is still

ass set the altcoin price soaring 122% from $16 all the way to 41 notably avalanche's bullish momentum remains resilient despite other top coins like Bitcoin and ethereum plunging into the red ahead of the US Federate decision which happened yesterday avalanche's price rally and ecosystem growth over the past month is largely attributed to its strategic focus on two blockchain narratives real world assets and game fight ahead of 2024 Avalanche recently announced strategic Partnerships with Trad five banking Giants including JP Morgan Chase and City Bank both institutions are set to leverage Avalanche and its blockchain subnets to develop rwa projects Additionally the Avalanche Foundation has also initiated Avalanche Vista a $50 million fund dedicated to rwa research and development importantly earlier this year Bernstein a prominent private wealth management firm predicted $3 trillion worth of assets will be tokenized within the next 5 years it's only logical that investors have been betting big on avac in recent weeks in a bid to front run the potential gains from The rwa Narrative between November 11th and December 12th the total value locked on the Avalanche ecosystem has increased from 573 million to 936 million avalanche now appears to be at the Forefront to capture this rwa Market this $363 million growth in Avalanches tvl largely explains why the Apex coin added 10 billion do to its market cap in the last 30 days apart from rwa Avalanche also strategically positioned itself as the largest blockchain focus on the gamei sector this architecture enables game developers to create highly scalable and bespoke blockchains attracting top gaming Studios to build on the the Avalanche blockchain with the global gaming Market expected to reach a $1.4 trillion valuation by 2030 avalanche's subnet architecture is a key differentiator considering that investors who bought avac during that period have been holding the bag for about 18 months many of them could look to exit once the price appreciates to their Break Even Point again that selling pressure could force a price correction but if the bullish impact of avalanche's soaring tvl intensifies as observed in December so far the Bulls could Garner enough momentum to smash through the $45 resistance Zone and reclaim $50 so mon base mem coin Bon surged 40% in the past 24 hours after prominent exchange coinbase said it would list a token on Thursday making it the third largest mcoin behind Dogecoin and chinu to be offered on the platform The Exchange said in an announcement on Wednesday once a sufficient supply of the asset is established trading on our Bon USC training pair will launch in phases and support for Bon may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions Co Bas listings have often led to a short-term pump and token prices given the exchange's tendency to be selected with the tokens it offers and a listing may give Traders a sense of legitimacy for the listed projects bong's price reversed nearly all losses from last week following the announcement and Bong traded at 15 on Thursday morning with a trading volume of over $235 million the tokens were issued last December in the aftermath of San bman Frey's downfall which prompted a sharp drop in sentiment for the salana ecosystem despite initially being fashioned as a meme coin Bon saw quick adoption in the

aggregator Chances Are Not Your Average Joe not your average investor and look I'm not saying you should not invest in a project because it sounds too techy no but I'm saying that you should invest in what real retail users understand and so if a project has good technology great infrastructure nice tokenomics that support value creation awesome go for it but what matters most in a bull run narratives and specifically ones that make sense things like memes gaming AI right artificial intelligence things you can wrap your head around while sipping your morning coffee don't go after projects you don't understand here are some of the benefits of avoiding this particular mistake you avoid speculative hype you minimize your risks and you stick to your long-term Vision perhaps most importantly my suggestion therefore is to focus on a niche that is a pro tip especially for riding the bull without getting tossed around because too much diversification in a bull market can kind of be like juggling flaming torches or machetes take your pick it sounds exciting but it's risky instead better to pick a niche that speaks to you matches your Vibe and most importantly matches your trading temperament and risk appetite because whether you're into meme coins or gaming tokens you can find your groove and stick to it you're probably going to do better and remember it's not just about the tech it's about the narrative that you believe in and the one that you feel is going to best catch on that also means the one that retailers are most likely to get behind numbers matter in crypto think about it Bitcoin Remains the leading crypto because we can all see that it's the safest and honestly there's not a whole lot of complexity around it so focusing on a niche really allows you to be an expert in that particular field of crypto whatever it is you may choose that means you can spot the best projects to invest in and be on top of the trends that are worth jumping into imagine centralized exchange trading access and liquidity but with no kyc you can get the volume and the pricing you need without any kyc requirements using bfy it's true you can trade over 400 trading pairs in the spot Market or 150 pairs in the pers market and you can withdraw 0.5 BTC daily plus fees are super low we're talking 0.6% for futures and per trades slippage is basically non-existent and you can trade with up to 200 times leverage or set and forget with the auto invest and again all with no kyc you're also going to get up to $8,699 in bonuses for trying BFI along with

don't rotate your bag let's look at another classic mistake that people tend to make in a bull cycle and that's the temptation to become what's called a rot it's kind of like when your friend's flashing new coin is skyrocketing and then suddenly your bag feels like it's stuck in snooze mode now it's totally normal to want to join the shiny coin party but the truth is that recklessly rotating may just be what's actually most likely to get you wrecked so here's a scenario your current bag might not have much going on but switching it up just because the grass looks Greener elsewhere is not a good idea that's kind of like changing your pizza order mid delivery because someone else's pizza looks fancier trust me you're going to see a lot of fancy pizzas in a ball Market that is the reality but that's not a reason to dive in you don't want to switch horses mid-race or pizzas mid delivery and look there are going to be all kinds of crazy successful projects in a bull market most just pump and dump and some are just headed for a rug pull so you stand a chance to fall prey if you easily rotate your bag to just accommodate what's trending it's short term it's fickle investing inclusively rotating during a bull market might mean missing out on your bag's time to shine and if your bag has carefully selected projects that's really a disservice to your strategy and your long-term choices markets are like roller coasters they have their UPS they have their downs and sometimes your bag just needs a moment in the spotlight yes it's tempting to follow the shiny objects but really the secret sauce is made up of patience and strategy insert whatever corny analogy you want here Rome wasn't built in a day right but neither are crypto fortunes know when to cut your losses let's talk about a lesson most of us have learned the hard way unfortunately not marrying our bags during a bull run raise a finger if you're watching this video and you've been there before right watching your favorite altcoin mooning and thinking yeah this is the one it's a nice feeling but the reality is that the market tends to have a way of humbling even the best of us during the last Bull Run many of us held our bags a little too close myself included only to see our gains slip away lesson learned don't let love blind you right altcoins are fantastic for profits but they're not supposed to be your Forever partner the solution here is to always have a plan know when to cut your losses and resist the fomo driven urge to stick around for some extra gains remember that greed works for the market so always exit when your strategy says so and don't let emotions Cloud your judgment if you follow these rules and you're a little bit robotic a little bit automated in terms of sticking to your plan and your strategy you'll be fine do not neglect or underestimate newer projects many of us made this mistake during the last cycle we kept all our powder for older projects and we missed out on some of the newer altcoins out there we found that newer projects tend to outperform old ones in a bull run context now of course Bitcoin is an exception for this for obvious reasons but here's why you should look out for newer projects first of all they don't have underwater bag holders from last cycle who are looking for an exit their circulating Supply is much much lower and this is always good for explosive pumps right it's easier for a $5 million market cap project to go up 1,000% than it is for a $5 billion market cap project it's just simple math also new projects often improve upon their predecessors now I'm not saying to ignore older Legacy projects I'm just saying to make some room to invest in the newer ones if that makes sense don't skip Bitcoin one of the biggest mistakes that people make in a bull run is not holding any BTC it's the OG and it's the safest bet in town Bitcoin always leads the charge and we're much more certain about its long-term relevance than we are about most altcoins finally don't ignore social media but going a little bit further don't fail to optimize it because it can make your life a lot easier social media remains your secret sauce in a bull run and some of you made this mistake last time and paid for it unfortunately don't ignore the right social media platforms Deep dive into platforms like altcoin buzz Alpha
